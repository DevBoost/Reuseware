Each application must have the following structure:

/plugins  
  - plugin1
  - plugin2
  - ...

Eclipse plugin projects that are required to make the example run. 
These are usually metamodels, model editors, and extensions 
to reuseware extension points.

/examples
  - example1
  - example2
  - ...

Different examples, where each can be checked out as an Eclipse project.
