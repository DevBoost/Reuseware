This metamodel for OpenOffice documents was obtained by
translating the OASIS OpenDocument RelaxNG schema
(www.oasis-open.org/committees/office/) into an XSD schema using Trang
(www.thaiopensource.com/relaxng/trang.html). The XSD schema was
converted into an Ecore metamodel by EMF's XSD-to-Ecore binding
(help.eclipse.org/help33/topic/org.eclipse.emf.doc/tutorials/xlibmod/xlibmod.html).
